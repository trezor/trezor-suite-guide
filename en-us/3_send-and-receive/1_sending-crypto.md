# Sending crypto

Sending a transaction is a straightforward process, but please make sure all transaction details are correct on your Trezor before confirming anything.

1. The transaction recipient will provide you with an address. **Copy this into the Address field.**
2. **Enter an amount to send.** This can be denominated in fiat or crypto. Always check it is correct before proceeding.
3. **Set a network fee.** Preset amounts are calculated based on current network throughput. A custom amount can also be set. Trezor Suite will warn you if the fee is abnormally high, but you can check average fees for recent transactions online to set a reasonable price.
4. Click **Review & Send.** Ensure all details shown on-screen are correct and the exact same address and amount are shown on your Trezor device.
5. Confirm the transaction on your Trezor and then click **Send** in Trezor Suite.

#### **Fees**

Network transaction fees vary depending on how busy the network is. Trezor Suite estimates fees based on the priority of the transaction. **Standard** fees offered are classed as Low, Normal, and High. You can set a custom fee using the **Advanced** tab in the Fee section.

Fees are only used to pay miners for adding transactions to the blockchain. They are not paid to Trezor or SatoshiLabs.
