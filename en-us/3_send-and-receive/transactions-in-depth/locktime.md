# Locktime

Locktime creates a transaction that only broadcasts when a certain time or block height has been reached. Setting a locktime is as simple as stating the blockheight or date at which it should broadcast, and then signing the transaction as usual.

Broadcast is turned off by default when using locktime, meaning you will receive raw text data to broadcast from a node. If Broadcast is on, the transaction will be sent over the current network.

#### How to set a locktime

To set a locktime while creating a transaction:

1. On the **Send** form, click the ellipsis (...) to reveal the drop-down menu, where you will find the **Add Locktime** option:

3. Use the drop-down menu to switch between **Date (UTC)** or **Block** format; enter a date or block height when it should broadcast.
4. Set a fee.
5. Confirm transaction details on your Trezor.
6. You will be shown confirmation details.
7. Copy the data to your clipboard or save it as a text document. When broadcasting (only after the block height has been reached) click **Send** instead.
8. Later, ideally from another network, use **Send RAW** or visit a block explorer to send the raw transaction data.
