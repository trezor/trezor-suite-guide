**Backup**: informs you of the status of your Trezor device backup, i.e., whether or not you've set up your wallet backup (recovery seed).

* If you've already created your backup, you'll see the grayed-out **'Backup successful'** button.
* If you have not already created your backup, please click on **Create backup** and set it up **as soon as possible:**
