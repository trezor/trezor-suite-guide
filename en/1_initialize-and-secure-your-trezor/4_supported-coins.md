# Supported coins

Trezor hardware wallets support hundreds of coins and tokens, both natively in Suite and through third party tools. A full list of coins and compatible wallets is available on the [Supported coins](https://trezor.io/coins) page on the Trezor knowledge base.

Trezor Suite natively supports fifteen cryptocurrencies and all ERC20 and SPL tokens. Other cryptocurrencies are supported by Trezor hardware wallets but must be managed using a third-party wallet interface such as Electrum or MetaMask.

Using a third-party wallet with your Trezor provides the same level of protection for your keys as Trezor Suite.

#### Adding a cryptocurrency asset in Trezor Suite

On the Trezor Suite Dashboard, click the **Enable more coins** button in the **Assets** overview section (just below the Portfolio graph). You will then be taken directly to the **Coins** settings menu:

* Enable (or disable) a cryptocurrency by clicking on it.
* A green check mark indicates that particular cryptocurrency is now enabled in Suite.

Cryptocurrencies can also be enabled from the **My accounts** menu:

* When on the **Accounts** page, click the plus icon (➕) in the **My accounts** sidebar.
* In the **New account** window, select **Activate more coins.**
* Then select the additional cryptocurrencies you want to enable in Suite, and click the **'Find my accounts'** button.
* For example, if you want to add Ripple (XRP): first click on ‘**XRP’** and then the '**Find my XRP accounts'** button.

The Coins settings menu can also be accessed by clicking on **Settings (⚙️)** in the top-right corner of Suite, and then selecting **Coins**.
