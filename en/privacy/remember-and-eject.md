# Remember and Eject

Trezor public keys can be stored on the host machine to track balances stored on the wallet. The Remember and Eject functions give you control over ease of use, privacy, and security for each wallet enabled on your Trezor.

Access the Remember and Eject settings by clicking on the top-left button showing your Trezor.  

**Remember** allows you to monitor your coin balances without needing your Trezor or your private keys. It tracks the wallet extended public key \(XPUB\), which gives information about address holdings. 

💡 If you store your Trezor in a secure place but want to watch any incoming or outgoing transactions, Remember lets you see account activity without needing to take your Trezor out of storage. 

**Eject** removes the wallet from view while Trezor Suite is running. Ejecting a Hidden Wallet will make the user enter the passphrase again. Ejecting a standard wallet will stop tracking address balances. To find the wallet again, click Add wallet, or reconnect and unlock your Trezor. 

⚠ If you are using a shared or public computer, wallet balances could be viewed by others who have access to the computer. Eject any saved wallets to prevent revealing this information.
